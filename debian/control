Description: FIX_ME write the Debian package description
 Write the short and long descriptions for the Debian package as
 explained in the Developer's Reference, §6.2.1 – §6.2.3.
 .
 You can start with the short upstream package description,
 “Regular expression for matching IP addresses (IPv4 & IPv6)”.
 .
 Be aware that most upstream package descriptions are not written to
 conform with Debian package guidelines. You need to explain the role
 of this package for a Debian audience.
